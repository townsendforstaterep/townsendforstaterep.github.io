    <div class="issue-card"><p>Having helped to develop the “Work Ready” program in Webster County, I believe we need to invest further in work force development programs. We need to ensure that our students are ready for whatever path they are called to, whether that is college or a career. I vow to support our working families if granted the opportunity to serve as your voice in Frankfort.</p></div>

    <div class="issue-card"><p>In many parts of our beautiful Commonwealth, our roads are crumbling and not being adequately repaired. As Webster County Judge/Executive, we always balanced our budget and always included funding for road projects. If elected in November, I will fight to do the same as your State Representative. Rebuilding our infrastructure is not only good for business but also provides jobs to our citizens. I will be a strong advocate for more infrastructure projects in the 12th District, as I have done as Judge/Executive.</p></div>

    <div class="issue-card"><p>As a former high school educator, I’ve seen first-hand how hard our teachers work to ensure the success of each and every child. I will fight to empower our teachers and support our children and grandchildren in the classroom.</p></div>
